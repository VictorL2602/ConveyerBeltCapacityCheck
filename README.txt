This program checks if a conveyor belt system can carry a given weight of packages using a certain number of motors.

-Each motor can carry 5.6 kg.
-The user is asked to enter:
 1.The number of motors (integer).
 2.The total weight of packages (can be decimal).
-The program calculates how much weight each motor would need to carry.
-If this value is less than or equal to 5.6, it prints:
 Yes! The conveyor belt can carry the packages.
-Otherwise, it prints:
 No. The conveyor belt cannot carry the packages.

-Input and output are handled with scanf and printf. The program uses simple C types: int for motors and double for weights.
-I have added explanations to each line of code, both for the user, and for the developer as personal notes.
